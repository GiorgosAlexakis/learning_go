# Singleton design pattern - Use cases
* Using the same connection to the database for every query.
* When you want to open a Secure Shell (SSH) connection to do some tasks on a server without needing to re-establish the connection for each task.
* You use a Singleton as the gateway to a variable or space if you need to restrict access to it.
* You build a Singleton instance to make the calls in the accepted window if you need to limit the number of calls to specific locations.
